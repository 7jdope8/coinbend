# Coinbend

![Coinbend UI](http://www.coinbend.com/screenshot.png)

Coinbend is an experimental, high security, decentralized exchange for trading cryptocurrencies that lets complete strangers trade coins with each other without the risk of fraud. It works by using a special combination of time-based cryptography along with a bunch of game theory to allow trades to take place with conventional smart contracts, thereby avoiding the need for a middleman to be trusted with a customerâ€™s deposits when exchanging money.

The exchange was built in response to the numerous hacks and scams that have plagued the Bitcoin world and was built specifically to avoid the need for a third-party to be trusted with any leverage over a customer's money. The software is currently in an an experimental state and lacks a proper order book so users must find each other through another channel to trade but the software is working so I'm releasing this as version 0.001.

Consider this the first practical and true P2P exchange for alt-coins. All existing attempts make unrealistic assumptions about attackers, require the use of collateral as a fail-safe, or strictly depend on third-party trust to exchange currencies (either directly or indirectly as a side-effect of transaction malleability) but Coinbend avoids these problems through the use of modified micro-payment channels and timechain enforced refunds.

... or something like that.

### Version
Pre-alpha v0.01

### Build
Coinbend uses Vagrant for reproducible development environments. Vagrant is like automation for VirtualBox and means you can have project specific developer environments that you can bring up with a single command. Especially useful for Coinbend which has a lot of dependencies that could easily break across environments.

First, fork the project to your Github and clone it.

```sh
mkdir coinbend-vagrant
cd coinbend-vagrant
git clone [your-forked-copy-of-coinbend]
```

Install the dependencies you need for Vagrant and Virtual box.

```sh
sudo apt-get install virtualbox vagrant
```

To have the virtual machine downloaded and setup for Coinbend develop:
```sh
cd coinbend/vagrant
sudo vagrant up
```

This command will take a while to complete as it has to download Python3.3 from scratch, compile it, install all the Python packages, download Litecoin + Dogecoin, plus do a lot of other stuff.

You can now make changes to the code with your favourite editor on your main OS and when you need to test the changes you can type sudo vagrant ssh to open a shell prompt to the VM. The VM already has everything needed to run the software from source so it's easy to hack the code.

## Hacking

When you first login to the custom VM it will start up Litecoin and Dogecoin on the testnet + setup a number of virtual interfaces. Coinbend is currently designed to work dynamically with full node cryptocurrencies so unfortunately you will have to wait for the blockchains to download. On fast Internet that's around a few hours of waiting but on a slow PC + Internet its incredibly painful: around 1 - 2 days of waiting for the chains to download and validate.

```sh
# 1 sep 2015 - blocks you need to DL.
# There will be a better way to develop Coinbend without full chains in the future.
vagrant@precise32:~$ /home/vagrant/coins/litecoin/bin/litecoin-cli getinfo
{
    "blocks" : 682511
}

vagrant@precise32:~$ /home/vagrant/coins/dogecoin/bin/dogecoin-cli getinfo
{
    "blocks" : 706056
}

```

After you login a number of virtual interfaces wil ble created. This allows you to simulate the interactions of nodes on a P2P network via the command line and by default IPs bound to eth1 and eth1:x will be accessible from your main / host OS so accessing the web UI of the software is as easy as visiting the IP in your browser.

To start the software for the first time:
```sh
vagrant@precise32:~$ cd /vagrant/coinbend
vagrant@precise32:~$ ifconfig | pcregrep -M "eth1:1[\s\S]*?inet addr"
eth1:1    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr ...  
          inet addr:192.168.1.147  Bcast:192.168.255.0  Mask:255.255.255.255

vagrant@precise32:~$ python3.3 -m "coinbend.main" -externalexchange 0 -erateinit BTC_USD_358.03,USD_AUD_1.2116072,LTC_BT0.00996000,DOGE_BTC_0.00000056 -clockskew -1 -interface eth1:1 -uibind 192.168.1.147 -passivebind 192.168.1.147 -directbind 192.168.1.147 -skipbootstrap 1 -localonly 1 -uselocaltime 1
...
Web server started.
Bottle v0.13-dev server starting up (using WSGIRefServer())...
Listening on http://192.168.1.147:7777/
```

And here's how it looks in the browser:
* Alice demo - http://alice.coinbend.com/
* Bob demo - http://bob.coinbend.com/

At this point you want to go to some faucets and send testcoins to your account addresses. Shoot me an email at matthew@roberts.pm if you need some testcoins or generate them yourself:
```sh
# Don't run them both at the same time - it will be too slow!
vagrant@precise32:~$ /home/vagrant/coins/litecoin/bin/litecoin-cli setgenerate true
vagrant@precise32:~$ /home/vagrant/coins/dogecoin/bin/dogecoin-cli setgenerate true
```

##### How to trade with yourself

Once you have a positive balance open two shells to your vagrant VM and do the following:
```sh
# Shell 1 - Alice
vagrant@precise32:~$ python3.3 -m "coinbend.main" -externalexchange 0 -erateinit BTC_USD_358.03,USD_AUD_1.2116072,LTC_BT0.00996000,DOGE_BTC_0.00000056 -clockskew -1 -interface eth1:1 -uibind 192.168.1.147 -passivebind 192.168.1.147 -directbind 192.168.1.147 -skipbootstrap 1 -localonly 1 -uselocaltime 1 -nodetype passive -trade "buy 200 dogecoin/litecoin @ 0.005"

# Shell 2 - Bob
vagrant@precise32:~$ python3.3 -m "coinbend.main" -externalexchange 0 -erateinit BTC_USD_358.03,USD_AUD_1.2116072,LTC_BT0.00996000,DOGE_BTC_0.00000056 -clockskew -1 -interface eth1:2 -uibind 192.168.1.148 -passivebind 192.168.1.148 -directbind 192.168.1.148 -skipbootstrap 1 -localonly 1 -uselocaltime 1 -nodetype passive -trade "sell 200 dogecoin/litecoin @ 0.005" -addnode passive://192.168.1.147:50500/p2p
```

These command line arguments tell the software not to calculate the exchange rate; not to detect the clock skew for the system clock; to bind to a specific virtual interface; to skip trying to find other nodes on the P2P network; to use LAN IP addresses for trade messages instead of WAN IPs (because WAN IPs don't work behind the same router); to switch the node type to passive (meaning you can accept inbound connections); to open a new order; and for Bob to connect to Alice.

##### Trading via the UI

1. Alice UI: http://192.168.1.147:7777 
2. Bob UI: http://192.168.1.148:7777
3. Alice: open a new order to buy 200 Dogecoins at 0.001 Litecoins per Dogecoin. Click submit. A confirmation dialogue will pop up.
4. Alice: at the bottom of the confirm dialogue click "generate copy of Node ID"
5. Alice: cnt + c
6. Bob: open a sell order to sell 200 Dogecoins at 0.001 Litecoins per Dogecoin. Click submit. A new confirmation dialogue will pop up.
7. Bob: cnt + v into the input box to paste Alice's node ID.
8. Bob: click "generae copy of Node ID"
9. Bob: cnt + c
10. Alice: cnt + v into the input box to paste Bob's node ID.
11. Submit the trade on both windows.

This is how I test the software most of the time (I told you this was experimental.)

### A brief primer on what everything is

Infrastructure for the project consists of 3 main components:
