This code hasn't been licensed yet but I intend to apply the LGPL to the majority of the code. The UI will likely be released as an independent project under a more restricted license (because stupidly - I used commercially licensed code to build the UI so it complicates things a bit but I can probably still get around this a little so that the UI is at least free to use.)
